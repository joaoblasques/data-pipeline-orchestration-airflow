## Ingesting data to local Postgres optimized

PostgreSQL’s COPY command is specifically designed for efficient bulk loading of data from a file (or memory buffer, in this case) into a table. It is highly optimized for performance, allowing it to insert large volumes of data in one go.

Lets modify the DAG with this COPY command inside process_and_insert_to_db function:

```python

def process_and_insert_to_db_with_copy(csv_name, user, password, host, port, db, table_name):

    # Connection to the PostgreSQL
    conn = psycopg2.connect(
        dbname=db, user=user, password=password, host=host, port=port
    )

    # Creates a cursor object for executing SQL queries
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Create the specified table if it does not already exist.
    create_table_query = f"""
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS {table_name} (
        "VendorID" TEXT,
        "tpep_pickup_datetime" TIMESTAMP,
        "tpep_dropoff_datetime" TIMESTAMP,
        "passenger_count" REAL,
        "trip_distance" REAL,
        "RatecodeID" TEXT,
        "store_and_fwd_flag" TEXT,
        "PULocationID" TEXT,
        "DOLocationID" TEXT,
        "payment_type" REAL,
        "fare_amount" REAL,
        "extra" REAL,
        "mta_tax" REAL,
        "tip_amount" REAL,
        "tolls_amount" REAL,
        "improvement_surcharge" REAL,
        "total_amount" REAL,
        "congestion_surcharge" REAL
    );
    """
    # Runs the query
    cursor.execute(create_table_query)
    # Commits the changes to the database, ensuring the table is created.
    conn.commit()
  
    # Read the CSV file in chunks
    df_iter = pd.read_csv(csv_name, iterator=True, chunksize=300000)
    for i, chunk in enumerate(df_iter):
        
        chunk['tpep_pickup_datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(chunk['tpep_pickup_datetime'])
        chunk['tpep_dropoff_datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(chunk['tpep_dropoff_datetime'])

        # Memory buffer is created using io.StringIO() to hold the chunk as a CSV
        buffer = io.StringIO()
        chunk.to_csv(buffer, index=False, header=False)
        # Moves the pointer to the beginning of the buffer to prepare it for reading
        buffer.seek(0)  

        # Insert the data from the buffer into the PostgreSQL table.
        cursor.copy_expert(f"COPY {table_name} FROM STDIN WITH CSV NULL ''", buffer)

        print(f"Inserted chunk {i + 1}")

        # Commits the changes to the database after each chunk is inserted.
        conn.commit()

    # After all chunks are processed, cursor and connection are closed
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()

```

The COPY command directly streams data into the database with minimal overhead, making it faster and more memory-efficient. SQLAlchemy, while flexible and powerful for general database management, isn’t designed to match the performance of PostgreSQL's COPY command for bulk inserts.
